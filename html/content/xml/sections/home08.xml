			<h1>Eric Kiel Photography Site Launch</h1>
			<body>Kiel's work spans a diverse range of subject matter, and his site needed to strike a balance between showcasing his client work and giving access to his large stock catalogue. Our design keeps his work front and center with minimal user interface. A powerful backend administration system gives Kiel's staff control over updates and site edits.</body>

			<h1>NeuSeed Logo Design</h1>
			<body>NeuSeed's work is on the cutting edge of genetic engineering. Our challenge was to create a logo that reflected this without overshadowing their focus on natural genetic processes. The final result is an intelligent mark, not only comfortable in front of investors, but right at home stitched to a hay & feed clerk's hat.</body>
