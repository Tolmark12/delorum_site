				<h1>A) RESEARCH</h1>
				<p>We encourage clients to approach projects with an open mind, using data and objectives to inform solutions. Research helps validate or reshape preconceptions of the objective, audience, product or need. Typically, in a Research phase we seek to:</p>
				<p>- Understand History and Context</p>
				<p>- Conduct Field Research</p>
				<p>- Identify Audiences</p>
				<p>- Define Project Constraints</p>
				<p>- Prioritize Objectives</p>
				
				<br/><h1>B) CONCEPT</h1>
				<p>Our concept exploration draws from research, media, technology, positioning and strategy. The creative magic happens here. New and innovative concepts or messaging differentiate and attract customers. We explore various concepts by:</p>
				<p>- Correlating Disparate Elements</p>
				<p>- Questioning Conventions</p>
				<p>- Questioning Limitations</p>
				<p>- Brainstorming</p>
				<p>- Abstract Visualization</p>
				
				<br/><h1>C) DESIGN</h1>
				<p>Design eliminates distracting elements, while balancing strategy, content and delivery. Successful design builds from and extends marketing objectives. This is where a project takes shape, is previewed, tested and approved. Tools that shape this stage include:</p>
				<p>- Principles of Art and Design</p>
				<p>- Dynamic, Appropriate Media</p>
				<p>- Stylistic Differentiation</p>
				<p>- Visual Messaging</p>
				<p>- Consumer Testing</p>
				
				<br/><h1>D) PRODUCTION</h1>
				<p>Once a solution is approved, production begins. Our early planning and detailed approvals help avoid technical and budgetary surprises in production. During the production process, typcially we oversee:</p>
				<p>- Budgets</p>
				<p>- Deadlines</p>
				<p>- Prototype Creation</p>
				<p>- Production Scheduling</p>
				<p>- Vendor Supervision</p>
				<p>- Quality Control</p>
