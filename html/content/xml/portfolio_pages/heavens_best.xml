Buy-off was crucial, as the burden of transitioning fleet and promotional materials rested primarily with  franchise owners. The presentation met with nearly unanimous support. One franchisee immediately purchased 12 new vehicles to speed his transition to the new brand.</p></txt>

				<txt><br/><h1>Good-but-not-too-Expensive</h1><br/><p>Keeping the brand message affordable but trusted was a fine line to walk. We refined the chosen direction into a contemporary consumer brand directed at a middle-class female audience. Then we developed and oversaw the implementation of all brand elements, including copy writing, photography, advertising, fleet signage, uniforms, web site, packaging, and training materials.</p></txt>
