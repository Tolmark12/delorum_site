				<txt yMod="66"><h1>Stretching the Rules of Printing</h1><p>For Playmill’s printed collateral, format was key to gaining public attention. We shifted Playmill’s collateral to a lengthened vertical format, nearly doubling the poster height. The longer format is completely distinct and builds easily recognized brand continuity between campaigns. Beyond that, the format takes advantage of production processes, and has actually reduced Playmill’s production costs.</p></txt>

				<txt><h1>Zig and Zag</h1><p>Engaging, lighthearted illustration provides a charming alternative to tired western cliches. The bold painterly </p><p>style differentiates Playmill from </p><p>typical tourist imagery while directly referencing Playmill's signature pre-show. The campaign illustrations were quickly adopted as the basis for the theatre’s redesigned interiors, earning Delorum show tickets, free fudge and a Northwest Region Silver Addy. </p></txt>
