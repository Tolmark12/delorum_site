				<txt yMod="66"><h1>Stretching the Rules of Printing</h1><p>For Playmill’s printed collateral, format was key to gaining public attention. We shifted Playmill’s collateral to a lengthened vertical format, nearly doubling the poster height. The longer format is completely distinct and builds easily recognized brand continuity between campaigns. Beyond that, the format takes advantage of production processes, and has actually reduced Playmill’s production costs.</p></txt>

				<txt><h1>Zig and Zag</h1><p>Engaging, lighthearted illustrations were our solution to overused, plastic cliches. The illustration style differentiates Playmill from more typical tourist imagery, and more closely represents the energetic, theatrical Playmill experience. The campaign illustrations were also adopted as the basis for the theatre’s updated interior design, earning Delorum complimentary tickets, free fudge and a Northwest Region Silver Addy. </p></txt>
