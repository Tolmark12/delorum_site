					<h1>Branding for Visibility</h1><p>Trucks and drivers are the most visible link to Ibex. We designed trucks and uniforms to position the company on a daily basis. Invoices, reports and paper work provide the primary link for office personnel, so we created user-friendly, branded materials to establish Ibex as the preferred vendor.</p>

					<h1>For what it’s worth...</h1><p>Just after launch, IBEX received a telling request from one competitor’s long-time employee. The driver supplied his jacket and asked to have the Ibex logo embroidered, whatever the cost. He just liked the logo.</p>
